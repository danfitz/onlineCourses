## Goals of course

This course will teach you

1. the machine learning algorithms, and
2. practical advice on when and how to _apply_ them.

Just like how you can't just build a house by learning how to use a hammer and a drill, you can't build machine learning systems just by learning the algorithms.

That's why this course spends a lot of time on _application_.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning definition:

> "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."
>
> â€” Arthur Samuel (1959)

There are 4 types of machine learning:

- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Recommender systems
- Reinforcement learning

Supervised learning is used _most_ in real-world applications. Additionally, it's seen the most rapid advancements.

Courses 1 and 2 focus on supervised learning, while course 3 focuses on the rest.

## Supervised vs. unsupervised learning

### Supervised learning

**Supervised learning** is a set of machine learning algorithms that learn $f(x) = y$ input-output mappings. The key way it learns these mappings is by providing a set of input examples, where the "right" output for each example is known upfront.

Eventually, the supervised learning algorithm learns to accept input $x$ alone and can return a reasonably accurate prediction of output $y$.

**Note**: The function $f$ is the learning algorithm that you use.

One type of supervised learning algorithm is a **regression** algorithm. These algorithms are defined by the fact that they try to predict a number from _infinitely_ many possible numbers.

For example, we may have a set of house sizes (inputs) and their prices (outputs). Given this data, we build a regression algorithm that can take 750 square feet as input and output the predicted price of the house.

> **Fun fact**: If you plot learning algorithm $f$ on an x-axis and y-axis, sometimes it is a straight line, sometimes a curve, or some other shape relative to the data. What shape it is depends on how you systematically _configure_ the learning algorithm.

Another type of supervised learning algorithm is a **classification** algorithm. These algorithms are defined by the fact that they try to predict a _finite small_ number of output _categories_ or _classes_ (where outputs can be non-numeric).

For example, we may have a set of tumors, where inputs are sizes and outputs are possible diagnoses of the tumors:

You can use more than one input value!
