## Goals of course

This course will teach you

1. the machine learning algorithms, and
2. practical advice on when and how to _apply_ them.

Just like how you can't just build a house by learning how to use a hammer and a drill, you can't build machine learning systems just by learning the algorithms.

That's why this course spends a lot of time on _application_.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning definition:

> "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."
>
> â€” Arthur Samuel (1959)

There are 4 types of machine learning:

- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Recommender systems
- Reinforcement learning

Supervised learning is used _most_ in real-world applications. Additionally, it's seen the most rapid advancements.

Courses 1 and 2 focus on supervised learning, while course 3 focuses on the rest.

## Supervised vs. unsupervised learning

### Supervised learning

**Supervised learning** are a set of machine learning algorithms that learn $f(x) = y$ input-output mappings. The key way it learns these mappings is by providing input examples, where the "right" output for each example is known upfront.

Eventually, the supervised learning algorithm learns to accept input $x$ alone and can return a reasonably accurate prediction of output $y$.

Regression: predicting a number from infinitely many possible numbers.
