## Auditing Tools

Here's some useful auditing tools:

* [webpagetest.org](https://webpagetest.org) gives you a full audit with letter grades
* Lighthouse (built into Chrome dev tools)
* [Sonarwhal](https://sonarwhal.com)

**What is GZIP?** It's a compression format that the browser automatically knows how to de-compress. So all you have to do is GZIP your files in your server before serving them.
