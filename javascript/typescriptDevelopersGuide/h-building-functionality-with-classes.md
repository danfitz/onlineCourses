# Building Functionality with Classes

## Instance Method Modifiers

The following modifiers change access for a class's properties or methods:

- `public`
  - By default, all properties and methods have `public` access: the method and property can be accessed from anywhere any time.
- `private`
  - Can only be called by _other methods_ in that same class
- `protected`
  - Can be called by others methods in the same class _or_ child classes' methods
