# Getting Started with TypeScript

## TypeScript Overview

Think of TypeScript as JavaScript + **the type system**.

Here's a summary of the type system at a high level:

- **Purpose:** Helps us catch error _during development_
  - In contrast, JavaScript only gives errors at _runtime_
  - TypeScript can catch errors by constantly analyzing your code
- **How:** Uses _type annotations_ to analyze the code
  - Think of annotations as little comments to describe the purpose/information about the program
- **Disclaimers:**
  - Disappears once you compile the code down to JS and deploy and/or run the application
  - Does NOT provide any performance optimizations
