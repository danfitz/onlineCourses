# Tree Traversal

The basic question behind **tree traversal** is this: given any kind of tree, **how do you visit every node once**?

With any list (like linked lists or arrays), traversal is simple: go from start to finish or left to right.

There are 2 main approaches to tree traversal:

1. **Breadth-first search**: working your way horizontally through each level of the tree (i.e. siblings)
2. **Depth-first search**: working your way vertically through each branch of the tree (i.e. parents and children)
