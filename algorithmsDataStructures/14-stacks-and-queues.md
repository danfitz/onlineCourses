# Stacks and Queues

## Stacks

### What is a stack?

A stack is an abstract data structure that abides by the **last in, first out (LIFO)** principle: the last element added to a stack will be the first one removed.

A real-life example of this is a stack of plates: the last one you washed and put in the cupboard is always the first one you use!

### Use cases

* **Call stack**: used to manage function invocations
* **Undo/redo**: new actions are added to the top of the stack, and undoing those actions removes the most recent action
* **Routing history**: a history of the routes you've visited in a browser are modeled as stacks
