## Motivation for Big O Notation

There are dozens of algorithms and/or data structures that can solve a problem you're faced with, and each one can be fundamentally different in its approach.

How do we know which is best? **Big O notation** is about generalizing code and talking about its **performance** compared to other pieces of code.

More importantly, big O notation allows us to **numerically represent** the performance of our code (as opposed to using vague descriptions like "it's OK" or "pretty good").

**Note**: Big O notation isn't a black and white calculation that can tell you the best solution in all cases. Implementations can have trade-offs.
