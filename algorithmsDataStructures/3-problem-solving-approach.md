# Problem Solving Approach

You're faced with a tough challenge. What are the steps you can take to make it solvable? This section will focus on **devising a plan or approach** to solving such a problem: steps you can take to make it easier.

## Objectives

* Define what an algorithm is
* Devise a plan to solve algorithms
* Compare and contrast problem solving patterns like frequency counters, two pointer problems, and divide and conquer

## How to Solve a Problem

Here's the basic steps to solving a problem:

1. Understand the problem
2. Explore concrete examples
3. Break it down
4. Solve/simplify the problem
5. Look back and refactor
