# Problem Solving Approach

You're faced with a tough challenge. What are the steps you can take to make it solvable? This section will focus on **devising a plan or approach** to solving such a problem: steps you can take to make it easier.

## Objectives

* Define what an algorithm is
* Devise a plan to solve algorithms
* Compare and contrast problem solving patterns like frequency counters, two pointer problems, and divide and conquer

## How to Solve a Problem

Here's the basic steps to solving a problem:

1. Understand the problem
2. Explore concrete examples
3. Break it down
4. Solve/simplify the problem
5. Look back and refactor

### 1. Understand the problem

It's tempting, especially in a stressful setting like an interview, to jump straight into solving a problem. However, here's some things you want to do to make sure you **understand the problem** first:

* Try to restate the problem in your own words.
* What are the inputs that go into the problem?
* What are the outputs that *should* come from the solution to the problem?
* Can the outputs be *determined* from the inputs? In other words, are the inputs enough information to get the outputs expected?
* How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem? Is there key *terminology* I should create? (Example: parameter names)

### 2. Explore concrete examples



### 3. Break it down

### 4. Solve/simplify the problem

### 5. Look back and refactor
