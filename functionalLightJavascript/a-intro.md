# Intro

## Why Functional Programming?

### Why answer the question at all?

Coding isn’t done in a bubble. It’s done in teams. So if you want to implement functional programming in your team’s code, you’ll need to convince your teammates of its value.

### Imperative vs. declarative

The first thing often said about the value of functional programming boils down to the distinction between imperative and declarative.

**Imperative** programming is where your code says **how** something is to be done. You know some code is imperative if a reader has to *mentally execute* the code in their minds, pretending to think like a computer.

However, this is error prone, as humans aren’t great at thinking like computers. As a result, imperative code is harder to understand, making it harder to maintain, to fix, and to improve.

**Declarative** programming, in contrast, is focused more on the **what** or the **outcome**. It’s code that, to the best extent possible, doesn’t require code commenting because the intention and outcome is clear.

### Confidence and surface area

Functional programming principles are grounded on sound mathematical reasoning. Just like we know 1 + 1 = 2 without needing proof, we can trust functional programming patterns/principles because they have been mathematically proven by very smart people.

Functional programming, therefore, gives you **confidence** in your code—an alternative to testing!

As a result of this confidence, you don't have to worry about a good chunk of your code. More attention can go to your business logic. You are reducing the **surface area** of what you have to maintain and debug.

## Course Overview

This course takes a **bottom-up** approach, focusing on the fundamental building blocks to get you *started* on your functional programming journey. (Contrast this with a top-down approach, which focuses on high-level theory first, making the content more inaccessible.)

The topics will be:

1. **Functions**: what they are and how they work
2. **Closure**: arguably a foundation to do anything else in functional programming
3. **Composition**
4. **Immutability**
5. **Lists/Data Structures**: things like map, filter, reduce
6. **Async**
7. **Helper Libraries**: libraries that help make functional programming quicker
