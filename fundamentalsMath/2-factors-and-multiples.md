# Factors and Multiples

The topic of this section has to do with the **relationships** between numbers. For example, we know that `12` and `-12` are related in that they're *opposites* of each other.

Similarly, how do numbers like `10` and `15` relate, especially given that `10 = 5 * 2` and `15 = 5 * 3`?

## Divisibility

We say that integer `x` is **divisible** by integer `y` when:
1. `y` divides *evenly* into `x`, or
2. The result of the division is a *whole number*, or
3. We don't get a *remainder* from the division.

Here's some **shorthand tricks** for determining the divisibility of the following numbers:

* *Divisible by 2* if the last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
* *Divisible by 3* if the sum of the digits is divisible by 3
* *Divisible by 4* if the last two digits are divisible by 4
* *Divisible by 5* if the last digit is 0, 5
* *Divisible by 6* if divisible by 2 and 3
* *Divisible by 7* if 5 Ã— last digit + rest of the number is divisible by 7
  * **Example**: Is `126` divisible by `7`?
    * The last digit is `6`, so `6 * 5 = 30`
    * The rest of the numbers make up `12`, so `12 + 30 = 42`
    * `42` is divisible by `7`!
* *Divisible by 8* if the last three digits are divisible by 8
* *Divisible by 9* if the sum of the digits is divisible by 9
* *Divisible by 10* if the last digit is 0
