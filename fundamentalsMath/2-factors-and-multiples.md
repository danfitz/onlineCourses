# Factors and Multiples

The topic of this section has to do with the **relationships** between numbers. For example, we know that `12` and `-12` are related in that they're *opposites* of each other.

Similarly, how do numbers like `10` and `15` relate, especially given that `10 = 5 * 2` and `15 = 5 * 3`?

## Divisibility

We say that integer `x` is **divisible** by integer `y` when:
1. `y` divides *evenly* into `x`, or
2. The result of the division is a *whole number*, or
3. We don't get a *remainder* from the division.

Here's some **shorthand tricks** for determining the divisibility of the following numbers:

* *Divisible by 2* if the last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
* *Divisible by 3* if the sum of the digits is divisible by 3
* *Divisible by 4* if the last two digits are divisible by 4
* *Divisible by 5* if the last digit is 0, 5
* *Divisible by 6* if divisible by 2 and 3
* *Divisible by 7* if 5 Ã— last digit + rest of the number is divisible by 7
  * **Example**: Is `126` divisible by `7`?
    * The last digit is `6`, so `6 * 5 = 30`
    * The rest of the numbers make up `12`, so `12 + 30 = 42`
    * `42` is divisible by `7`!
* *Divisible by 8* if the last three digits are divisible by 8
* *Divisible by 9* if the sum of the digits is divisible by 9
* *Divisible by 10* if the last digit is 0

## Multiples

A **multiple** of `x` is any number that is a product of `x` times a whole number. For example, `2 * 3 = 6`, `2 * 4 = 8`, and `2 * 5 = 10`, so `6`, `8`, and `10` are all multiples of `2`.

Another way of thinking about multiples is that a multiple is *divisible* by its base. `10 / 2` divides evenly into the whole number `5`, so `10` is a multiple of `2`.

## Prime and Composite

You can classify any whole number greater than 1 as either **prime** or **composite**. A **prime number** is only divisible by either `1` or itself. A **composite number** is divisible also by a whole number *other than* `1` or itself.

`7` is a prime number.
`21` is a composite number because it is divisible by `7` and `3`.

**Note**: Another way of thinking about prime and composite is to ask if any whole number between `1` and the number in question divide evenly into the number. For example, it's a given that `1` and `5` divide evenly into `5`. But what about `2`, `3`, and `4`? Because those numbers don't divide evenly into `5`, `5` is a prime number.
