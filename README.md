# Dan's Continued Learning Syllabus

This is a roadmap of everything I'm learning now or interested in learning next.

## NOW

I'm currently learning **React** in more depth (including Redux, React Router, Hooks)! I want to understand the intricacies of React and learn to use it to its full potential.

I'm also currently learning **Node.js**, so I can better understand how to work with the backend for a large-scale application I'm building at work.
