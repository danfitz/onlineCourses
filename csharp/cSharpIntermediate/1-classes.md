# Classes

## Intro to Classes

### What is a class?

A class is a **building block** of an application. All these classes _together_ provide the _behaviour_ of an application.

A class has 2 parts:

- Data represented by **fields**
- Behaviour represented by **methods**

To declare a class:

```cs
public class Person
{
  public string Name; // field
  public void Introduce() // method
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Hi, my name is " + Name);
  }
}
```

**Note**: `public` is an access modifier that you'll learn about later.

### Examples of classes

In a real-world application, there are usually 3 layers to any application:

1. **Presentation layer**

   - How the data looks

2. **Business layer**

   - The business logic

3. **Persistence layer**
   - Data access

Example:

1. `PostView` displays post information to a user
2. `Post` handles the logic of posts
3. `PostRepository` knows how to save to or read from a database

### What is an object?

Objects are **instances of classes**. If `Person` is a class, then `John`, `Mary`, and `Scott` are objects of that class.

To instantiate an object:

```cs
Person person = new Person();
```

### Static members

Some fields and methods are accessible from class instances. These are called **Instance members**.

```cs
var person = new Person();
person.Introduce();
```

On the other hand, some fields and methods are accessible from the class itself. These are called **static members**.

```cs
public class Person
{
   public string Name;

   public static string Species = "mammal";
   public static Person Parse(string str)
   {
      var person = new Person();
      person.Name = str;
      return person;
   }
}

Person.Species;
var person = Person.Parse("Dan");
```

Notice how we use the `static` access modifier to set a static member!

**Pro tip**: We use static members when the concept we are representing is a **singleton**, i.e., it only needs one place in memory and not duplicates. For example, `DateTime.Now` only needs one instance. It's redundant to duplicate the current time in different objects.

## Constructors

A **constructor** is simply a _method_ that is called when an _instance of a class is created_. This is useful for initializing some fields in the class.

```cs
public class Customer
{
   public Customer()
   {
   }
}
```

**Important details**:

- A constructor _must_ have the same name as the class.
- The above constructor is known as a _parameter-less_ or _default_ constructor.
- If you don't provide a constructor yourself, the compiler will automatically add a default constructor in for you.
- If any fields don't get initialized, they fallback to their default values:
  - `int` becomes `0`
  - `bool` becomes `false`
  - `char` becomes `''`
  - reference types like `string` and objects become `null`

Here's a constructor with actual parameters:

```cs
public class Customer
{
   public string Name;
   public Customer(string name)
   {
      this.Name = name;
   }
}

Customer customer = new Customer("Dan");
```

**Note**: The `this` keyword references the current object being initialized.

### Constructor overloading

In classes, you can utilize **constructor overloading** where you define _more than one_ constructor to account for different parameters.

```cs
public class Customer
{
   public Customer() {
      // ...
   }
   public Customer(string name) {
      // ...
   }
   public Customer(int id, string name) {
      // ...
   }
}
```

Constructor overloading allows your class to be used more flexibly. For example, sometimes you don't know the `id` of a customer, their `name`, or both. You want to be able to create a customer in any of these cases.

**Note**: When you constructor overload, your class won't automatically create the default parameter-less constructor _for you_, so you need to explicitly define it like above.

**Important**: A constructor is considered unique based on the _order_ of the parameter data types.

### Calling constructors inside other constructors

Sometimes one of your class' constructors has all of the initialization you want in another constructor. In this case, it would be great to be able to re-use a constructor _inside_ another constructor.

For example, whenever you create a field containing a data type like a `List`, you need to initialize it before it can be used (otherwise it will default to `null`).

```cs
public class Customer
{
   public List<int> Grades;

   public Customer()
   {
      this.List = new List<int>();
   }
}
```

In cases like the above (and more), you don't want to have to explicitly initialize the `List` in every other constructor. Instead, you can re-use your constructors inside other constructors:

```cs
public class Customer
{
   public int Id;
   public string Name;
   public List<int> Grades;

   public Customer()
   {
      this.List = new List<int>();
   }

   public Customer(int id)
      : this()
   {
      this.Id = id;
   }

   public Customer(int id, string name)
      : this(id)
   {
      this.Name = name;
   }
}
```

`this()` and `this(id)` always get called **before** the constructor runs. So in effect, you are _stacking_ constructor initialization.

**Pro tip**: Stacking constructor initialization, although possible, is not recommended due to the way it requires you to trace what's going on. It's a better idea to limit this stacking to initialization that you _have_ to performâ€”like initializing a `List`.

## Object Initializers

**Object initializers** allow you to initialize an object _without_ using a class constructor.

```cs
var person = new Person
{
   FirstName = "Dan",
   LastName = "Fitz"
}
```

The reason object initializers were added to C# was they prevented the need to constructor overload to account for _every possible_ combination of initialized values.

Instead, the idea is to restrict constructors to initialization that **must** happen in order for the object to work.

**Note**: When you initialize an object using an object initializer, the default constructor _still_ runs first.

## Methods

### Signature of methods

The **signature** of a method is basically its

1. Name, plus
2. The number and type of parameters

```cs
public class Point
{
  // This method is characterized by name "Move" and int x and int y
  public void Move(int x, int y) {}
}
```

### Method overloading

Just like how you can overload constructors, you can **overload methods**.

This is especially useful when you want to give the consumer of your class more options around that method.

```cs
public class Point
{
  // When you have 2 coordinates
  public void Move(int x, int y) {}

  // When you have a Point instance
  public void Move(Point newLocation) {}

  // When you have a Point instance and a speed!
  public void Move(Point newLocation, int speed) {}
}
```

### Params modifier

Suppose you have a method that could take a varying number of parameters. For example, the `Add` method might need that.

```cs
public class Calculator
{
  public int Add(int a, int b) {}
  public int Add(int a, int b, int c) {}
  public int Add (int a, int b, int c, int d) {}
}
```

Overloading, like in the case above, wouldn't work because there's an infinite number of cases to consider.

Well, what if you passed an _array_ instead?

```cs
public class Calculator
{
  public int Add(int[] numbers) {}
}

int result = calculator.Add(new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4 });
```

This works! But there's only one downside: every single time you want to pass arguments to `Add`, you have to place the data in an array. That's a bit awkward.

To solve this, C# gives us the **params modifier**. This modifier collects all of your method's parameters _into_ an array for you.

```cs
public class Calculator
{
  public int Add(params int[] numbers) {}
}

// Supports passing an array
var result = calculator.Add(new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4 });
// Or passing individual arguments
var result = calculator.Add(1, 2, 3, 4);
```

### Ref modifier

The **ref modifier** allows you to pass the reference for a variable, so you can update the value of that variable inside your method.

```cs
public class MyClass
{
  public void MyMethod(ref int a)
  {
    a += 2;
  }
}

var a = 1;
classInstance.MyMethod(ref a);
Console.WriteLine(a); // 3
```

Notice how `ref` is used for the argument _and_ the parameter. This is required.

**Note**: The ref modifier is not best practice, so please try to avoid it.

### Out modifier

The **out modifier** is pretty much identical to the ref modifier with the exception that you don't have to initialize the variable before passing it into the method. However, you _do_ have to initialize the variable _inside_ the method.

```cs
public class MyClass
{
  public void MyMethod(out int a)
  {
    a = 3; // initialization required
  }
}

int a; // not initialized
classInstance.MyMethod(out a);
Console.WriteLine(a); // 3
```

You may use the out modifier at times though, so it's good to know. One common use case is with `int.TryParse`. This method allows you to convert a string into an int without throwing an exception if it fails.

```cs
int number;
var result = int.TryParse("abc", out number);
if (result)
  Console.WriteLine(number);
```

## Fields

If you recall, fields are like variables inside of a class.

### Initialization

You've seen that initialization of a field can happen inside a constructor:

```cs
public class Customer
{
  List<Order> Orders;

  public Customer()
  {
    Orders = new List<Order>();
  }
}
```

However, some developers believe constructors should be reserved for only when you want to initialize fields based on values passed from the _outside_.

To preserve this approach to constructors, we can initialize inline:

```cs
public class Customer
{
  List<Order> Orders = new List<Order>();
}
```

**Pro tip**: Both approaches are reasonable. Just make sure you're consistent.

### Read-only fields

The `readonly` modifier sets it so that a field can only be **initialized once** (either inline or in the constructor).

```cs
public class Customer
{
  readonly List<Order> Orders = new List<Order>();
}
```

This is useful when you want to make sure some data doesn't get overwritten by accident.

## Access Modifiers

An **access modifier** controls access to a class and its members. You've seen some like `public` before. Here is a list of all of them:

- `public`
- `private`
- `protected`
- `internal`
- `protected internal`

We only care about `public` and `private` here. The others have more to do with _inheritance_.

**Why access matters**: Just like the `readonly` modifier, it improves safety of our code, preventing bugs.

### Encapsulation

In the modern factory approach to work, we separate out responsibilities and _encapsulate_ it to roles. A chef doesn't need to know what a waitress is responsible for and vice versa, but they help each other.

In software, especially object-oriented programming, each **class** is similarly encapsulated. One class shouldn't need to know how another class does what it's responsible for. It should just be able to use that class like a black box.

Also known as _information hiding_, **encapsulation** is the hiding of data (fields) or behaviour/functionality (methods) in classes.

### Encapsulation in practice

In practice, encapsulation in C# means 2 things:

1. Hide fields using `private`, and
2. Access them through getter and setter methods that are `public`.

We want to hide fields because they are considered an **implementation detail**. We don't want to give access to _how_ the class works, only what will make it work.

```cs
public class Person
{
  private string _name;

  public void SetName(string name)
  {
    if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(name))
      this._name = name;
  }
  public string GetName()
  {
    return _name;
  }
}
```

**Note**: One of the benefits of the setter/getter pattern is you can perform _logic checks_ before initializing or retrieving fields. In the example above, we don't initialize name unless it has a real value.

**Note on convention**:

- Notice how we name the private field `_name`. By convention, private fields are always formatted as camel case prepended with a `_`.
- Whereas the class itself and its methods are formatted as pascal case.

## Properties

**Properties** are class members that encapsulate a setter and getter for accessing a field. It basically allows you to create a setter and getter with **less code**.

```cs
public class Person
{
  // Field
  private string _name;

  // Property
  public string Name
  {
    get { return _name; }
    set { _name = value; }
  }
}
```

**Note on convention**: The property is pascal case as well!

To shorten this code even more, C# can automatically set the private field for us and implement the property's setter and getter. This is known as an **auto-implemented property**. Just follow this syntax:

```cs
public class Person
{
  public string Name { get; set; }
}

var person = new Person();
person.Name = "Dan"; // setter
Console.WriteLine(person.Name); // getter
```

**Note**: Notice how it looks like we're directly updating a field. This isn't true. Behind the scenes, C# is using the getter and setter to update the field internally.

### Customizing the setter in a Property

If you want to only be able to set a property once and never again, you can (1) initialize the property in a constructor plus (2) set the setter to `private`.

```cs
public class Person
{
  public string Name { get; private set; }

  public Person(string name)
  {
    Name = name;
  }
}

var person = new Person("Dan");
person.Name = "John"; // throws an error!
```

On the other hand, if you want a property to be dynamically determined without the ability to manually set it, you can (1) customize how the getter works plus (2) not create a setter.

```cs
public class Person
{
  public string FirstName { get; set; }
  public string LastName { get; set; }
  public string FullName
  {
    get
    {
      return FirstName + " " + LastName;
    }
  }
}

var person = new Person();
person.FirstName = "Dan";
person.LastName = "Fitz";
Console.WriteLine(person.FullName); // "Dan Fitz"
```

## Indexers

An **indexer** is a way to access elements in a class that represents a _list of values_.

You've seen indexers before in arrays and lists:

```cs
var array = new int[5];
array[0] = 1; // indexer

var list = new List<int>();
list[0] = 1; // indexer
```

To build your own indexer in a class, it's literally just like building a property:

```cs
public class HttpCookie
{
  public string this[string key]
  {
    get {}
    set {}
  }
}
```

**Things to note**:

- Notice how we use `this` because the indexer doesn't have a name.
- `string key` is the indexer.
