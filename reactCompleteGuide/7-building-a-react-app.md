# 7 - Building A React App

## Planning A React App

Before you even start a React app, you want to figure out these 3 things:

1. **Component tree/structure**. When looking at a UI, you want to know how the site will be split into components. What deserves to be its own component and what doesn't?

2. **Application state or data**. What are the main bits of data you'll be using in the application?

3. **Components vs. containers**. Which components will just be presentational and dumb? Which will hold state and contain the presentational components?
